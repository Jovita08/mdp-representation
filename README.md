# <p align="center">MDP REPRESENTATION</p>

## AIM:
To represent any one real-world problem in MDP form.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

### Problem Description :
Plants are important due to its various beneficial factors. So it is necessary to take care of them. With reinforcement learning we can train a agent to ensure the growth of a saplings.

### State Space :
{Dead, Sapling, Plant}

### Sample State :
Sapling

### Action Space :
{Pouring water on regular interval, not pouring water}

### Sample Action : 
Pouring water on regular interval

### Reward Function :
+1-on pouring water regularly, 0-otherwise
